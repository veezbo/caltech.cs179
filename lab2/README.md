CS179 Lab 2
-------

For this project, I changed nothing but the bump.vert, bump.frag, parallax.vert, and parallax.frag files, and part of the main file we were supposed to change. Additionally, bump.vert and parallax.vert have all of the same code. Everything I did compiled and ran on worked on Ubuntu 12.04.

Just ```make``` to compile. Then, there will be an executable called glslRenderer in the same directory, that should be called with command line arguments for either bump or parallax mapping, like so:
    
    ./glslRenderer bump.vert bump.frag
    ./glslRenderer parallax.vert parallax.frag
