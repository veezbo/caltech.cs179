For this project, I changed nothing but the simple.vert and simple.frag classes. Everything I did compiled and ran on worked on Ubuntu 12.04.

I removed the compiled object files and executable, so just make to compile. Then, there will be an executable called glslRenderer in the same directory that should give the desired shiny cow.
