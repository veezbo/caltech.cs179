The only changes made to the original code were:

particles_simple.cu: changed the initial positions in temppos to positions all across the screen (i.e. in 4 2D quadrants, rather than just the first)

simple_kernel.cu: simply added the position update based on initial velocity for all the points- no calculation of acceleration.


Everything ran and compiled on Ubuntu 13.04 using a GTX 460.
